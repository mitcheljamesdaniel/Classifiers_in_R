Machine Learning Classifiers Tutorial
-----------------------

Use 4 different machine learning classifiers to predict whether loan applications will be approved. Machine learning classifiers are commonly used for a wide range of problems such as disease diagnosis, detecting fraudulent activity, flagging emails as spam, and predicting whether loans will be repaid. This tutorial provides an overview of when to use machine learning classifiers, the advantages and limitations of several common machine learning classifiers, and how to implement, interpret, and visualize them.

You can see the tutorial itself <a href=https://mitcheljamesdaniel.github.io/projects/Classifiers_Tutorial/index.html> here </a>.

Below are the instructions for running the underlying R code.

Instructions
-----------------------

* Clone this repo to your computer
* Open the R project, Classifiers.Rproj
* Inside the R project, open Classifiers.Rmd
* Use renv to recreate the project's environment:
    * renv will automatically bootstrap itself when you open the project
    * you can use renv::status() to see what packages (and versions) must be installed for the code to run
    * use renv::restore() to automate installation of these packages
* Run the script
